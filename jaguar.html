<p><strong>Looks</strong></p>
<p>Jaguars coats come in variety of colors, including yellow, reddish-brown,
 and black. The spots on their coat are called <em>rosettes</em> because
they are shaped like roses. Leapords also have rosettes, but a jaguar's have
 dots in them. Jaguars' have a a compact body, extremely sharp teeth, broad head, and powerful jaws. They are the third biggest cat in the world and the biggest in the Americas'.</p>
<p><strong>Food</strong></p>
<p>Jaguars' aren't picky. They will eat peccary, deer, camians (alligator-like 
creatures), snakes, eggs, fish, and anything else they can catch. Scientists have recentlly discovered that jaguars are the only big cat to hunt from the ground, the water, and trees.
Another thing that sets jaguars' apart from other cats is the way they hunt. They get closer to their prey than any other cat, less than twenty feet. When they strike, they don't struggle 
with it. They take one big chomp on the back of their preys neck.

 <p><strong>Habitat</strong><p>
 <p>These cats don't just live in the rainforest. They live in mountian scrub areas, pampas grasslands, and a few other places. Their current range streches from Mexico to Argentina.</p>
 <p><strong>Behavior and Life Cycle</strong></p>
 <p>Jaguar babys are born in a thicket or cave den. The kittens begin hunting when they are about six months old. They leave their mother when they are about two years old and go on a trip to
 find new territory, traveling up to 150 miles.</p>
 <p><strong>Why They are Endangered</strong></p>
 <p>Jaguars are endangered because of habitat loss and overhunting. About 15,000 are in the wild right now. People are cutting down
 trees to make way for farms and for lumber. Also, people are shooting them for huntung cattle
 and also for their precious coats. The easiest thing you can do to help is recycle, so less trees are cut down for paper.</p>
